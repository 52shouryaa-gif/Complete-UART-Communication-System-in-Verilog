# Complete-UART-Communication-System-in-Verilog
This project implements a full UART communication system in Verilog HDL. The top module connects:  • Baud Rate Generator • UART Receiver (RX) • UART Transmitter (TX)  The design supports serial communication with ready and busy control signals and can be directly used in FPGA-based systems for serial data transfer.
